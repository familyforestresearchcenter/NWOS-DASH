<p><h4>How to use NWOS-DASH?</h4></p>
<p>NWOS-DASH is the official data visualization and retrieval tool for the National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS). Here you can obtain summarized data on landowners' objectives, activities, demographics and more - summarized by state and region.</p>
<p>The <b>Univariate Results</b> tab on the navigation bar allows a number of options for summarizing individual variables. You begin by selecting the variable, statistical unit, state/region, population, domain, and survey year from the selection menu. A plot based on your custom selection will be generated. The plot is interactive. By mousing over the bars, you will be able to see exact values. Buttons on the top allow you to zoom, change axes and other plot attributes, and finally to export the plot as a static image file. The TABLE and PLOT tabs allow you to toggle between this plot view and an interactive table view. You can also download the table as CSV or JSON using the buttons on the bottom of the selection menu.</p>
<p>The data on the <b>Univariate Results</b> tab correspond to tables that are published in official USDA publications. Underneath each plot/table, includes the full citation for the data. Additional information about methods, terminology, and results for the corresponding study can be found in the cited publication.</p>
<p>The <b>Mapped Results</b> tab provides the same data as the Univariate Results tab, but displayed on an interactive map of the United States. Instead of choosing an individual state/region and variable and seeing data for all levels of that variable, here you choose a specific level of a variable (e.g. 'Individual' as one level of 'Ownership type') and a chloropleth map is generated. This map is interactive; you can zoom, pan, and mouse over states to see exact values and error terms. Variables, levels, populations, and domains are restricted to those that are available at the level of individual states.</p><html xmlns:mso="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" xmlns:msdt="uuid:C2F41010-65B3-11d1-A29F-00AA00C14882"><head>
