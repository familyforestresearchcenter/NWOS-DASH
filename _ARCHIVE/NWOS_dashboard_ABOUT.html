<p><h4>U.S. Forest Service, National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS)</h4></p>
<p>There are over 800 million acres of forestland in the U.S. and most of this land is privately owned. Approximately 36% of the forestland is owned by families and individuals, 31% by the federal government, 19% by corporations, 9% by state governments, 2% by tribal groups, 2% by other private groups, and 2% by local governments.</p>
<p>The National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS) is aimed at increasing our understanding of private forest owners, including:</p>
<ul><li>How many private forest owners there are?</li>
<li>Why they own land?</li>
<li>What they have done with their forests in the past?</li>
<li>What they plan to do with their forests in the future?</li></ul>
<p>Summary information from the NWOS is used by people who provide, design, and implement services and policies that impact private forest owners, including government agencies, landowner organizations and other non-governmental organizations, private service providers, business analysts, forest industry companies, and academic researchers.</p>
<p>The National Woodland Owner Survey is implemented by the <a href='http://www.familyforestresearchcenter.org/' target='_blank'>Family Forest Research Center</a>, a joint venture between the U.S. Forest Service and University of Massachusetts Amherst. More information on the NWOS, including summary tables and survey instruments can be found <a href='https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/nwos/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
